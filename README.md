# Rems
Rems is a R wrapper of EMS database API. With Rems package, you will be able to retrieve the EMS data from R without the low-level knowledge of the EMS RESTful API. The project is still in very early alpha stage, so is not guarranteed working reliably nor well documented. I'll beef up the documentation as soon as possible. 

Any contribution is welcome!
